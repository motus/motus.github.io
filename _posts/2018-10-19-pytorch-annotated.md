# pytorch-annotated project

I've started a small project to document PyTorch internals. Eventually I hope to cover low-level
APIs, like ATen and good old TH.

I will start with a simple python notebook that explores the components of the
[PyTorch MNIST example](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/mnist).

Here's the new git repository: [pytorch-annotated](https://github.com/motus/pytorch-annotated).
