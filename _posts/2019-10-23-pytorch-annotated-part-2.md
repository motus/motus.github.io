# pytorch-annotated: MNIST Example Part 2

In the second part of my
[PyTorch MNIST example](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/mnist) annotation
I cover the forward propagation and `torch.nn` components used in the example.

Here's the link to the python notebook:
[Model components and forward propagation](https://github.com/motus/pytorch-annotated/blob/master/mnist/2_mnist_model.ipynb).
