# Our paper has been accepted to ICLR 2019!

Woo hoo, New Orleans, here I come! Just got an email from the organizers that our paper has been
accepted to the ICLR conference. Of course, all credit goes to Saeed -- I just helped with the
engineering part and ran a few experiments. I really hope that we'll be able to open source the code
soon -- it has some modules that can be useful for domains other than SAT. Meanwhile, here's the
paper:

[Learning To Solve Circuit-SAT: An Unsupervised Differentiable Approach](https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJxgz2R9t7)
