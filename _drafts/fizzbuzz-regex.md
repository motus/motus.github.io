# How to troll your interviewer: FizzBuzz with regular expressions

Since
[the original post](https://imranontech.com/2007/01/24/using-fizzbuzz-to-find-developers-who-grok-coding)
on [FizzBuzz](http://wiki.c2.com/?FizzBuzzTest) interview question, there was a multitude of takes
on this problem. They range from short and sweet (like e.g.
[this one](https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell_Quiz/FizzBuzz/Solution_Acontorer) in Haskell) to funny
monstrosities in Cobol, Brainfuck, and enterprisey Java. There's even a blog post where author
[trains a neural net](http://joelgrus.com/2016/05/23/fizz-buzz-in-tensorflow) with one hidden layer
to solve that problem. ([Nikos](http://lowrank.net) joked that they should've used the
[Neural Turing Machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5401) instead).

Unfortunately (or, rather, quite fortunately), I am well past that point in my career when I had a
chance to hear such question on my coding interview. But - hypothetically - if some interviewed asks
me to implement FizzBuzz on a whiteboard, what should I do? Write some Haskell code, or build a
neural net? I know, I'll use regular expressions! :-)
